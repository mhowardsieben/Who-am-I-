# Who-am-I-
The Who am I project
This is me *insert picture*. My name is Mikael, Mikael Alexander Howard-Sieben, Mike if you want. I'm a 15 year old high schooler, my current classes are Social-1 AP and Introductory Computer Science. My hobbies include video making *hyper link social video*, video games, music, and of course sleeping. I hail from the country of Canada, born in Edmonton, Alberta. My grandparents on my mothers side are French and English although apparently I look more like my fathers side, which is Italian and German.
