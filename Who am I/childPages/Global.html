            <h3>As an adovcate for CANZUK.</h3>
              <article>
                <p>
                  This one is primarly in relation to language and culture, CANZUK is a proposed economic union between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The idea is that it would also extend to travel agreements and maybe even a shared space agency. The main idea for this economic union is based upon the similarities all these countries have such as a shared monarch, similar national values, all of us has English as one of our Official Languages, and the fact that these nations are all former members of the British Empire. One of the other goals of CANZUK that tickles my fancy the most is the idea of forming a third "pillar" of democracy, this would prevent dominance of Canada by the US, the UK by the EU, and the oceanic countries by China. Of course as a staunch Royalist and Nationalist I would be in favor of this union which would keep Canada strong and free from the dominance of other world super powers.
