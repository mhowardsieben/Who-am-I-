            <h3>Within My Family</h3>
              <article>
                <p>
                  My family is very important part of my life, as it should be an important part of everyone elses life. Family is probably the first collective anyone is introduced too, they give you their language, customs, religion, and general habits. My whole family comes from Europe, my mom is English and French, my dad is German and Italian. My family does the normal North American of Euro descent stuff, Christmas, Easter, Halloween... you know stuff like that. No ones religous or goes to church, well my elder cousin is a Germanic Pagan, but thats a him thing. Everyone in my family is an anglophone, although my grandmothers grandparents spoke welsh, so my grandma has a speach impedemant from mixing English with that god foresaken rubik's cube of a language. I find actually talking with my family quite entertaining, and interesting considering half of them take antipsychotics. I've always considered my mom a role model considering she raised me and my sibilings single handidly, while also attending university. She always entertained my interests as well, from answering my questions about movie special effects, to encouraging my love of music.
