          <h3>As a musician</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                Well I used to be in instrumental band, I play guitar, I spend all day just listening to or playing music, and I plan on taking singing lessons after the covid-19 vaccine is out... so hopefully around April. Point is music is one of my passions, it's one of the most important parts of being Mikael. My love of music comes from the raw emotion that escapes the mechanations of man kinds making, the rythmic thud the bass provides, the energizing pounding of the drum, the melodic strumming of the guitar, and of course the manipulation of the body to create a beautiful harmonic voice.
